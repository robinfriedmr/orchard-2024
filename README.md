# Orchard (2024)

*Work in progress.*

Growing an orchard is a matter of cycles and time. Trees need nutrients to grow fruit, fruit must ripen before it falls, and seeds must be planted in clean soil. Three players take on these roles, with the ultimate goal of growing an orchard.

I led the original design and development of this game during the 2017 Mentored Undergraduate Student Experience. Our three-person research team was exploring the possibilities of lightweight networked games; I challenged myself to create a multiplayer game where each player had a distinct mini-game that both influenced and was influenced by the others.

Now, seven years later, I have picked up development in this dedicated repository. It is a side-project, so updates may be sporadic. You can find the 2017 version in this repository: [Orchard](https://github.com/robinfriedmr/Orchard).
